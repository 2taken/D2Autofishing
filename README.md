This shitty tool is made for the tightest screen bounds, 1920x1080 screen resolution (change either setting or capture dictionary in config) and Windows OS.

If you need you can add delay before catching in config, since some people get empty hooks without it for some reason.

Also put brightness to lowest and window mode to "windowed fullsreen" just to be safe.
